A Java-based "Student Management System" designed to manage student records efficiently.
This project allows users to 'add, view, update, delete, and search student details' using a simple and structured approach.
It is developed as a "mini project" to understand core Java concepts and basic database/file handling.

Features

* Add new student records
* View all student details
* Update existing student information
* Delete student records
* Search students by ID or name
* User-friendly and menu-driven interface
